Use the theme folder as our git repo.
You will need to setup XAMPP or LAMP so that you can test locally.

TO TEST LOCALLY:

After installing XAMPP, you will need a SQL server to connect to. Use the sql files provided to create a local database with them. 

Now you will need to create a wordpress admin user. Use this link for that: http://www.inmotionhosting.com/support/edu/wordpress/333-add-admin-via-mysql

Now you need to get the wordpress files.
You should most likely create your local git repo as follows:

~wherever/projects/LRC/wp-content/themes/friendship/
your LRC folder will need to be your root. You will need to set up friendship as the repo's folder or else we can't do this thing. Actually looking at it we will need to name the repo friendship and just have all the files from the server on there. We don't have enough space on github to copy the entire site to it.
